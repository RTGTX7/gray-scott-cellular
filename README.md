## Introduction

This project implements a 2D **Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model** using the **Cell-DEVS formalism**. The model captures the nonlinear interaction and diffusion between two chemical species (**u** and **v**) over a grid of cells, resulting in complex spatial patterns such as spots, waves, and stripes.

For a full explanation of the Gray-Scott model and its Cell-DEVS mapping, refer to the paper:

## Dependencies

This project has already included **Cadmium** installed and accessible via the environment variable `$CADMIUM`.

> ‚úÖ **Note:** If you are using the DEVSsim server, you can skip this step ‚Äî all required dependencies are pre-installed.

## Build

To compile the project, simply run:

```bash
source build_sim.sh
```
NOTE: Everytime you run build.sh, the contents of build/ and bin/ will be replaced.

## Execute

To run the simulation, use:

```bash
./bin/gray-scott-cellular config/AbigdotConfig.json <simulation_steps>
```

Replace `<simulation_steps>` with the number of steps you wish to simulate.  
For example, to simulate 1000 time steps:

```bash
./bin/gray-scott-cellular config/AbigdotConfig.json 1000
```

You can increase the number (e.g., 500+) for full pattern emergence.

## Configuration

Edit the simulation setup in:

```
config/grayScottConfig.json
```

This file defines:
- Grid shape and boundary conditions
- Initial seed positions and concentrations
- Visualization fields and color mappings

---
### `main.cpp`
Entry point of the simulation; initializes and launches the Cell-DEVS model using Cadmium.

### `grayScottCell.hpp`
Defines the behavior of each cell in the grid, including local computation based on the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion equations.

### `grayScottState.hpp`
Defines the internal state of each cell, including concentrations `u`, `v`, and the derived `v_ratio`.

---

## üß™ Execution Output

The simulation generates an output file:

- `grid_log.csv` ‚Äî Contains the time evolution of cell states across the grid.

To visualize the simulation results:

‚û°Ô∏è **Open both** `config/grayScottConfig.json` **and** `grid_log.csv` **in the DEVS Viewer**.

This will allow you to view the dynamic pattern formation over time as computed by the Gray-Scott model.

## Introduction

This project implements a 2D **Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model** using the **Cell-DEVS formalism**. The model captures the nonlinear interaction and diffusion between two chemical species (**u** and **v**) over a grid of cells, resulting in complex spatial patterns such as spots, waves, and stripes.

For further discussion on the role of Turing patterns in vegetation ecosystems, see:

## Dependencies

This project assumes you have **Cadmium** installed and accessible via the environment variable `$CADMIUM`.

> ‚úÖ **Note:** If you are using the DEVSsim server, you can skip this step ‚Äî all required dependencies are pre-installed.

---

## Build

To compile the project, simply run:

```bash
source build_sim.sh
```
> **Note:** Every time you run `build_sim.sh`, the contents of `build/` and `bin/` will be replaced.

---

## Execute

To run the simulation, use:

```bash
./bin/gray-scott-cellular config/vegetation_init_101_0.1_Config.json <simulation_steps>
```

Replace `<simulation_steps>` with the number of steps you wish to simulate.  
For example, to simulate 50 time steps:

```bash
./bin/gray-scott-cellular config/vegetation_init_101_0.1_Config.json 50
```

You can increase the number of steps (e.g., 500, 1000) to observe the full evolution of patterns.

## Configuration

Edit the simulation setup in:

```
config/vegetation_init_101_0.1_Config.json
```

This file defines:
- Grid shape and boundary conditions
- Initial seed positions and concentrations
- Visualization fields and color mappings
---
### `main.cpp`
Entry point of the simulation; initializes and launches the Cell-DEVS model using Cadmium.

### `vegetationCell.hpp`
Defines the behavior of each cell in the grid, including local computation based on the Hardenberg vegetation Turing model.

### `vegetationState.hpp`
Defines the internal state of each cell, including soil water `W`, surface water `O`, and biomass `P`.

---

## üß™ Execution Output

The simulation generates an output file:

- `vegetation_log.csv` ‚Äî Contains the time evolution of cell states (biomass, soil moisture, and surface water) across the grid.

To visualize the simulation results:

‚û°Ô∏è **Open both** the selected configuration file (e.g., `config/vegetation_init_101_0.1_Config.json`) **and** `grid_log.csv` **in the DEVS Viewer**.

This will allow you to view the spatial pattern formation of vegetation over time as computed by the Hardenberg model.
